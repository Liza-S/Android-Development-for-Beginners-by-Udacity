The app is done as task of course [Android Basics: User Input](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837).

####Task: 
When you press the button Print menu to logs the XML code has already been set up to trigger a method called printToLogs. Add code to this method to read data from each of the menu item TextViews and to print the value of each menu item to the logs.

Task have been done by me programmatically. In the log, when you press the button, the menu list appears, which was on application screen.
